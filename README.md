# 2019-NYC-Airbnb-Property-Data-Analysis

Group Project 1 involved choosing a dataset from an external source, using Python to process the data, and performing analysis based on generated visualizations. The members of the group are Sedra Kurdi, Myles Bridges, Natalie Myers, and Matthew Kennedy. The approach was to clean the data, and then process and analyze it at the city, borough, and neighborhood levels. Parameters identified for consideration included property type, price, availability for booking, minimum night requirement, and number of reviews.
